In IE and Safari, we have to guess source file names\r\n * by searching for function bodies inside all page scripts. This will not\r\n * work for scripts that are loaded cross-domain.\r\n * Here be dragons: some function names may be guessed incorrectly, and\r\n * duplicate functions may be mismatched.\r\n *\r\n * TraceKit.computeStackTrace should only be used for tracing purposes.\r\n * Logging of unhandled exceptions should be done with TraceKit.report,\r\n * which builds on top of TraceKit.computeStackTrace and provides better\r\n * IE support by utilizing the window.onerror event to retrieve information\r\n * about the top of the stack.\r\n *\r\n * Note: In IE and Safari, no stack trace is recorded on the Error object,\r\n * so computeStackTrace instead walks its *own* chain of callers.\r\n * This means that:\r\n *  * in Safari, some methods may be missing from the stack trace;\r\n *  * in IE, the topmost function in the stack trace will always be the\r\n *    caller of computeStackTrace.\r\n *\r\n * This is okay for tracing (because you are likely to be calling\r\n * computeStackTrace from the function you want to be the topmost element\r\n * of the stack trace anyway), but not okay for logging unhandled\r\n * exceptions (because your catch block will likely be far away from the\r\n * inner function that actually caused the exception).\r\n *\r\n * Tracing example:\r\n *  ```js\r\n *     function trace(message) {\r\n *         var stackInfo = TraceKit.computeStackTrace.ofCaller();\r\n *         var data = message + \"\\n\";\r\n *         for(var i in stackInfo.stack) {\r\n *             var item = stackInfo.stack[i];\r\n *             data += (item.func || '[anonymous]') + \"() in \" + item.url + \":\" + (item.line || '0') + \"\\n\";\r\n *         }\r\n *         if (window.console)\r\n *             console.info(data);\r\n *         else\r\n *             alert(data);\r\n *     }\r\n * ```\r\n * @memberof TraceKit\r\n * @namespace\r\n */\r\nTraceKit.computeStackTrace = (function computeStackTraceWrapper() {\r\n    var debug = false, sourceCache = {};\r\n    /**\r\n     * Attempts to retrieve source code via XMLHttpRequest, which is used\r\n     * to look up anonymous function names.\r\n     * @param {string} url URL of source code.\r\n     * @return {string} Source contents.\r\n     * @memberof TraceKit.computeStackTrace\r\n     */\r\n    function loadSource(url) {\r\n        if (!TraceKit.remoteFetching) {\r\n            //Only attempt request if remoteFetching is on.\r\n            return '';\r\n        }\r\n        try {\r\n            var getXHR = function () {\r\n                try {\r\n                    return new window$1.XMLHttpRequest();\r\n                }\r\n                catch (e) {\r\n                    // explicitly bubble up the exception if not found\r\n                    return new window$1.ActiveXObject('Microsoft.XMLHTTP');\r\n                }\r\n            };\r\n            var request = getXHR();\r\n            request.open('GET', url, false);\r\n            request.send('');\r\n            return request.responseText;\r\n        }\r\n        catch (e) {\r\n            return '';\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n    /**\r\n     * Retrieves source code from the source code cache.\r\n     * @param {string} url URL of source code.\r\n     * @return {Array.<string>} Source contents.\r\n     * @memberof TraceKit.computeStackTrace\r\n     */\r\n    function getSource(url) {\r\n        if (typeof url !== 'string') {\r\n            return [];\r\n        }\r\n        if (!_has(sourceCache, url)) {\r\n            // URL needs to be able to fetched within the acceptable domain.
